\section{Expected Outcomes}

The research study will explore different architectures for generating a valid classifier using CXR images. The research will produce a valid model which will be trained and tested for CXR images obtained from different labs. It shall classify the image report for the presence of \acrfull{cov} damages(pertaining damage). It will be further developed to predict the critical damage stage where a patient may need to be hospitalized.
