	abstract     = {The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature, including those that report findings on radiographs. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. Because a large portion of figures in COVID-19 articles are not CXR or CT, we designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved deep-learning (DL) performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza, another common infectious respiratory illness that may present similarly to COVID-19, and fine-tuned a baseline deep neural network to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We fine-tuned an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared 15 clinical symptoms and 20 clinical findings of COVID-19 versus those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. Our database is unique, as the figures are retrieved along with relevant text with fine-grained descriptions, and it can be extended easily in the future. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.},

Methods: A deep-learning model (CAPE: Covid-19 AI Predictive Engine) was trained on 2337 CXR images including 2103 used only for validation while training. The prospective test set consisted of CXR images (n=70) obtained from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients between 1 January and 30 April 2020 in a single center. The radiographs were analyzed by the AI model. Model performance was obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: In the prospective test set, the mean age of the patients was 46 (+/- 16.2) years (84.2% male). The deep-learning model accurately predicted outcomes of ICU admission/mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.96). Compared to traditional risk scoring systems for pneumonia based upon laboratory and clinical parameters, the model matched the EWS and MulBTSA risk scoring systems and outperformed CURB-65. Conclusions: A deep-learning model was able to predict severe patient outcomes (ICU admission and mortality) from COVID-19 on chest radiographs.}

	abstract     = {Fast and accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient and effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic that is currently disrupting the whole world. Despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak, relatively few diagnostic images are openly available to develop automatic diagnosis algorithms. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle when data is highly unbalanced with many cases in one class and only a few cases in another; new methods must be developed to overcome this challenge. We propose a novel activation function based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution from extreme value theory, which improves performance over the traditional sigmoid activation function when one class significantly outweighs the other. We demonstrate the proposed activation function on a publicly available dataset and externally validate on a dataset consisting of 1,909 healthy chest X-rays and 84 COVID-19 X-rays. The proposed method achieves an improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (DeLong's p-value < 0.05) compared to the sigmoid activation. Our method is also demonstrated on a dataset of healthy and pneumonia vs. COVID-19 X-rays and a set of computerized tomography images, achieving improved sensitivity. The proposed GEV activation function significantly improves upon the previously used sigmoid activation for binary classification. This new paradigm is expected to play a significant role in the fight against COVID-19 and other diseases, with relatively few training cases available.}

	abstract     = {COVID-19 pandemic has spread all over the world for months. As its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, the accurate and fast detection of the COVID-19 infection is crucial. Although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans, there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques. In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1-score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%). We further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance. At last, we design an automated deep learning methodology to generate a lightweight deep learning model MNas3DNet41 that achieves an accuracy of 87.14%, F1-score of 87.25%, and AUC of 0.957, which are on par with the best models made by AI experts. The automated deep learning design is a promising methodology that can help health-care professionals develop effective deep learning models using their private data sets.

Chest radiological imaging paired with artificial intelligence (AI) can offer significant advantages in diagnosis of novel coronavirus infected patients. To this end, transfer learning techniques are used for overcoming the limitations emanating from the lack of relevant big datasets, enabling specialized models to converge on limited data, as in the case of X-rays of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we present an interpretable AI framework assessed by expert radiologists on the basis on how well the attention maps focus on the diagnostically-relevant image regions. The proposed transfer learning methodology achieves an overall area under the curve of 1 for a binary classification problem across a 5-fold training/testing dataset.}

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of an automated machine learning algorithm in the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia using chest CT scans. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and positive predictive value. The method's average precision was 0.932. We suggest that auto-ML platforms help users with limited ML expertise train image recognition models by only uploading the examined dataset and performing some basic settings. Such methods could deliver significant potential benefits for patients in the future by allowing for earlier disease detection and care.}

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19 and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resource optimisation is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography. We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from seven cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images were used to pre-train the deep learning system, making it learn lung features. Following this, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19 (471 had follow-up for >5 days) and 342 with other pneumonia) from six cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the four external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC 0.87 and 0.88, respectively) and viral pneumonia (AUC 0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time had significant difference (p=0.013 and p=0.014, respectively). Without human assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings. Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening of COVID-19 and identifying potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimisation and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms. A fully automatic deep learning system provides a convenient method for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis, which can help COVID-19 screening and finding potential high-risk patients with worse prognosis https://bit.ly/3bRaxGw}

The former after simplification and discretization is a compact model of temporal infection trend of a region while the latter models the effect of nearest neighboring regions. The latter captures latent spatial information. We trained and tested our model on COVID-19 data in Italy, and show that it out-performs existing temporal models (fully connected NN, SIR, ARIMA) in 1-day, 3-day, and 1-week ahead forecasting especially in the regime of limited training data.},

However, the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR tests is low and it can take up to 8 hours to receive the test results. Radiologic methods can provide higher sensitivity. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of X-ray and convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to differentiate it from viral and/or bacterial pneumonia, as 2-class (bacterial pneumonia vs COVID-19 and viral pneumonia vs COVID-19) and 3-class (bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy group (BCH), and among viral pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy group (VCH)) experiments. METHODS 225 COVID-19, 1,583 healthy control, 2,780 bacterial pneumonia, and 1,493 viral pneumonia chest X-ray images were used. 2-class- and 3-class-experiments were performed with different convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architectures, with different variations of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. RESULTS The results showed that bacterial pneumonia vs COVID-19 and viral pneumonia vs COVID-19 reached a mean ROC AUC of 97.32% and 96.80%, respectively. In the 3-class-experiments, macro-average F1 scores of 95.79% and 94.59% were obtained in terms of detecting COVID-19 among BCH and VCH, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The ConvNet was able to distinguish the COVID-19 images among non-COVID-19 images, namely bacterial and viral pneumonia as well as normal X-ray images.}

	abstract     = {COVID-19 is posed as very infectious and deadly pneumonia type disease until recent time. Despite having lengthy testing time, RT-PCR is a proven testing methodology to detect coronavirus infection. Sometimes, it might give more false positive and false negative results than the desired rates. Therefore, to assist the traditional RT-PCR methodology for accurate clinical diagnosis, COVID-19 screening can be adopted with X-Ray and CT scan images of lung of an individual. This image based diagnosis will bring radical change in detecting coronavirus infection in human body with ease and having zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. This paper reports a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-image augmentation technique for detecting COVID-19 in chest X-Ray and chest CT scan images of coronavirus suspected individuals. Multi-image augmentation makes use of discontinuity information obtained in the filtered images for increasing the number of effective examples for training the CNN model. With this approach, the proposed model exhibits higher classification accuracy around 95.38% and 98.97% for CT scan and X-Ray images respectively. CT scan images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 94.78% and specificity of 95.98%, whereas X-Ray images with multi-image augmentation achieves sensitivity of 99.07% and specificity of 98.88%. Evaluation has been done on publicly available databases containing both chest X-Ray and CT scan images and the experimental results are also compared with ResNet-50 and VGG-16 models.}

METHODS Chest CT scans and X-Ray images collected from different centers and institutions were downloaded and combined together. Images were separated by patient and 66% of the patients were used to develop and train AI image-based classifiers. Then, the AI automated classifiers were evaluated on a separate set of patients (the remaining 33% patients). RESULTS (Chest X-Ray) Five different data sources were combined for a total of N=9,841 patients (1,733 with covid-19, 810 with bacterial tuberculosis and 7,298 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=3,528 patients. The best AI method reached an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for covid-19 detection of 99%, with a detection rate of 96.4% at 1.0% false positive rate. RESULTS (Chest CT scans) Two different data sources were combined for a total of N=363 patients (191 having covid-19 and 172 healthy patients). The test sample size was N=121 patients. The best AI method reached an AUC for covid-19 detection of 90.9%, with a detection rate of 90.6% at 24.6% false positive rate. CONCLUSIONS Computer aided automatic covid-19 detection from chest X-ray images showed promising results to be used as screening tool during the covid-19 outbreak. The developed method may help to manage patients better in case access to PCR testing is not possible or to detect patients with symptoms missed in a first round of PCR testing. The method will be made available online (www.quantuscovid19.org). These results merit further evaluation collecting more images. We hope this study will allow us to start such collaborations.}

Methods 904 axial lung window CT slices from 338 patients in 17 countries were collected and labeled. The data included 606 images from COVID-19 positive patients (confirmed via RT-PCR), 224 images of a variety of other pulmonary diseases including viral pneumonias, and 74 images of normal patients. We developed, trained, validated, and tested an object detection model which detects features in three categories: ground-glass opacities (GGOs) for COVID-19, GGOs for non-COVID-19 diseases, and features that are inconsistent with a COVID-19 diagnosis. These collected features are passed into an interpretable decision tree model to make a suggested diagnosis. Results On an independent test of 219 images from COVID-19 positive, a variety of pneumonia, and healthy patients, the model predicted COVID-19 diagnoses with an accuracy of 96.80 % (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.75 to 96.86) , AUC-ROC of 0.9664 (95% CI, 0.9659 to 0.9671) , sensitivity of 98.33% (95% CI, 98.29 to 98.40) , precision of 95.93% (95% CI, 95.83 to 95.99), and specificity of 94.95% (95% CI, 94.84 to 95.05). On an independent test of 34 images from asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, our model achieved an accuracy of 97.06% (95% CI, 96.81 to 97.06) and a sensitivity of 96.97% (95% CI, 96.71 to 96.97). Similarly high performance was also obtained for out-of-sample countries, and no significant performance difference was obtained between genders. Conclusion We present an interpretable artificial intelligence CT analysis tool to diagnose COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Further, our model is able to differentiate COVID-19 GGOs from similar pathologies suggesting that GGOs can be disease-specific.}

Respiratory disorders in COVID-19 caused by the virus commonly present as viral pneumonia-like opacities in chest X-ray images which are used as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. The surge places high demand on medical services including radiology expertise. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based automated decision support tools to alleviate radiological burden. We address this insufficiency by expanding training data distribution through use of weakly-labeled images pooled from publicly available CXR collections showing pneumonia-related opacities. We use the images in a stage-wise, strategic approach and train convolutional neural network-based algorithms to detect COVID-19 infections in CXRs. It is observed that weakly-labeled data augmentation improves performance with the baseline test data compared to non-augmented training by expanding the learned feature space to encompass variability in the unseen test distribution to enhance inter-class discrimination, reduce intra-class similarity and generalization error. Augmentation with COVID-19 CXRs from individual collections significantly improves performance compared to baseline non-augmented training and weakly-labeled augmentation toward detecting COVID-19 like viral pneumonia in the publicly available COVID-19 CXR collections. This underscores the fact that COVID-19 CXRs have a distinct pattern and hence distribution, unlike non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia and other infectious agents.}

Scientists are endeavoring to ascertain the drugs for its efficacious treatment. Because, till now, no full-proof drug is available to cure this deadly disease. Therefore, identifying COVID-19 positive people and to quarantine them, can be an effective solution to control its spread. Many machine learning and deep learning techniques are being used quite effectively to classify positive and negative cases. In this work, a deep transfer learning-based model is proposed to classify the COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays or CT scan images of infected persons. The proposed model is based on the ensembling of DenseNet121 and SqueezeNet1.0, which is named as DeQueezeNet. The model can extract the importance of various influential features from the X-ray images, which are effectively used to classify the COVID-19 cases. The performance study of the proposed model depicts its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and precision. A comparative study has also been done with the recently published works and it is observed the performance of the proposed model is significantly better.}

In a short period of time, Chinese medical workers have experienced the gradual understanding, evidence accumulation and clinical practice of the unknown virus.

However, it is difficult for clinicians and laymen to quickly and accurately distinguish the similarities and differences among the different versions and locate the key points of the new version. This paper reports a computer-aided intelligent analysis method based on machine learning, which can automatically analyze the similarities and differences of different treatment plans, present the focus of the new version to doctors, reduce the difficulty in interpreting the "diagnosis and treatment plan" for the professional, and help the general public better understand the professional knowledge of medicine. Experimental results show that this method can achieve the topic prediction and matching of the new version of the program text through unsupervised learning of the previous versions of the program topic with an accuracy of 100%.

The sports industry suffered a major blow with the uncertainty of sporting events being held in the near future. Various scenarios of how and when sports might recommence have been discussed. This paper examines various scenarios of how Major League Baseball team performance is going to be impacted by the presence of fans, or the lack thereof, in the context of physical distancing and other COVID-19 countermeasures Methods: The paper simulates, using a neural network and a logit regression model, the win-loss probabilities for various scenarios under consideration and also estimates the home effect for each team using data for the 2017-2019 seasons. Results: The model demonstrates that individual team home effect is symmetric between home and away and teams will not necessarily have a win or loss of any additional games in neutral stadiums, as teams with a high home field effect will lose more neutral games that would have been at home but will win more neutral games that would have been away. However, the result of individual games will be different since home effect is asymmetric between teams. Our simulation demonstrates that these individual game differences may lead to a slight difference in Play-Off Berths between a full season, a half season, or a full season without fans. Conclusions: Without fans, any advantage (or disadvantage) from home field advantage is removed. Our models and simulation demonstrate that this will reduce the variance. This stabilizes the outcome based upon true team talent, which we estimate will cause a larger divide between the best and worst teams. This estimation helps decision makers understand how individual team performance will be impacted as they prepare for the 2020 season under the new circumstances.}

	abstract     = {Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family, is a respiratory disease that rapidly reached pandemic proportions with high morbidity and mortality. It has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies in only a few months. COVID-19 presents numerous challenges to all aspects of healthcare, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications to healthcare. Machine learning is a subset of AI that employs deep learning with neural network algorithms. It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than humans. In this manuscript, we explore the potential for a simple and widely available test as a chest x-ray (CXR) to be utilized with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably. Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision. Our trained model overall demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94.8% and 98.9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91.8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88.8% for normal lung. We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs. Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. Finally, we developed and described a publicly available website to demonstrate how this technology can be made readily available in the future.}

	abstract     = {BRIEF INTRODUCTION Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, chest radiographs (CXR) have been proposed as a potentially useful tool for triage and disease progression monitoring. Although CXR is less sensitive than computed tomography (CT), a classic pattern for COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR would preclude the need for further imaging with CT. Deep learning (DL) approaches for COVID-19 detection on CXR have been proposed1,2; however, these studies have been limited by small numbers of images available for model training. Although the lack of large COVID-19 image data sets is a barrier to DL development, the nonspecific findings of COVID-19 raise the possibility of repurposing CXRs with overlapping radiographic findings as training data. We previously used a similar approach to develop a DL algorithm to detect pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)3; this algorithm was trained using CXRs that did not have diagnoses of TB, but did have similar radiographic findings, in particular consolidation. On the basis of the observation that the CXR findings of COVID-19 and TB overlap considerably,4 we hypothesized that this model would generalize well to COVID-19 CXRs.}

	abstract     = {The global outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has uncovered the fragility of healthcare and public health preparedness and planning against epidemics/pandemics. In addition to the medical practice for treatment and immunization, it is vital to have a thorough understanding of community spread phenomena as related research reports 17.9–30.8% confirmed cases to remain asymptomatic. Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time. This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics. To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time. Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.}

	abstract     = {Chest (computed tomography) CT scanning is one of the most important technologies for COVID-19 diagnosis in the current clinical practice, which motivates more concerted efforts in developing AI-based diagnostic tools to alleviate the enormous burden on the medical system. We develop a lesion-attention deep neural network (LA-DNN) to predict COVID-19 positive or negative with a richly annotated chest CT image dataset. The CT image dataset contains 746 public chest CT images of COVID-19 patients collected from over 760 preprints, and the data annotations are accompanied with the textual radiology reports. We extract two types of important information from these annotations: One is the flag of whether an image indicates a positive or negative case of COVID-19, and the other is the description of five lesions on the CT images associated with the positive cases. The proposed data-driven LA-DNN model focuses on the primary task of binary classification for COVID-19 diagnosis, while an auxiliary multi-label learning task is implemented simultaneously to draw the model's attention to the five lesions of COVID-19 during the training. The joint task learning process makes it a highly sample-efficient deep model that can learn COVID-19 radiology features effectively with very limited samples. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity (recall) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients are 91.2% and 85.7% respectively, which reach the clinical standards for practical use.

	abstract     = {Background Public health authorities have been recommending interventions such as physical distancing and face masks, to curtail the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the community. Public perceptions toward such interventions should be identified to enable public health authorities to effectively address valid concerns. The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used to characterize user-generated content from social media during previous outbreaks, with the aim of understanding the health behaviors of the public. Objective This study is aimed at developing and evaluating deep learning–based text classification models for classifying social media content posted during the COVID-19 outbreak, using the four key constructs of the HBM. We will specifically focus on content related to the physical distancing interventions put forth by public health authorities. We intend to test the model with a real-world case study. Methods The data set for this study was prepared by analyzing Facebook comments that were posted by the public in response to the COVID-19–related posts of three public health authorities: the Ministry of Health of Singapore (MOH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England. The comments made in the context of physical distancing were manually classified with a Yes/No flag for each of the four HBM constructs: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits. Using a curated data set of 16,752 comments, gated recurrent unit–based recurrent neural network models were trained and validated for text classification. Accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss were used to evaluate the model. Specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy were used to evaluate the classification results in the MOH case study. Results The HBM text classification models achieved mean accuracy rates of 0.92, 0.95, 0.91, and 0.94 for the constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, respectively. In the case study with MOH Facebook comments, specificity was above 96% for all HBM constructs. Sensitivity was 94.3% and 90.9% for perceived severity and perceived benefits, respectively. In addition, sensitivity was 79.6% and 81.5% for perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers, respectively. The classification models were able to accurately predict trends in the prevalence of the constructs for the time period examined in the case study. Conclusions The deep learning–based text classifiers developed in this study help to determine public perceptions toward physical distancing, using the four key constructs of HBM. Health officials can make use of the classification model to characterize the health behaviors of the public through the lens of social media. In future studies, we intend to extend the model to study public perceptions of other important interventions by public health authorities.}

Materials and Methods A convolutional Siamese neural network-based algorithm was trained to output a measure of pulmonary disease severity on anterior-posterior CXRs (pulmonary x-ray severity (PXS) score), using weakly-supervised pretraining on ~160,000 images from CheXpert and transfer learning on 314 CXRs from patients with COVID-19. The algorithm was evaluated on internal and external test sets from different hospitals, containing 154 and 113 CXRs respectively. The PXS score was correlated with a radiographic severity score independently assigned by two thoracic radiologists and one in-training radiologist. For 92 internal test set patients with follow-up CXRs, the change in PXS score was compared to radiologist assessments of change. The association between PXS score and subsequent intubation or death was assessed. Results The PXS score correlated with the radiographic pulmonary disease severity score assigned to CXRs in the COVID-19 internal and external test sets ({rho}=0.84 and {rho}=0.78 respectively). The direction of change in PXS score in follow-up CXRs agreed with radiologist assessment ({rho}=0.74). In patients not intubated on the admission CXR, the PXS score predicted subsequent intubation or death within three days of hospital admission (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve=0.80 (95%CI 0.75-0.85)). Conclusion A Siamese neural network-based severity score automatically measures COVID-19 pulmonary disease severity in chest radiographs, which can be scaled and rapidly deployed for clinical triage and workflow optimization.}

	abstract     = {Background: With the global outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic since early 2020, there has been considerable attention on CT-based diagnosis as an effective and reliable method. Recently, the advent of deep learning in medical diagnosis has been well proven. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to detect the COVID-19 infection imaging features in a chest CT scan. We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans. Method: Our dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes. Results: We compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively. By employing Bayesian statistics to calculate the accuracies at a 95% confidence interval, ai-corona surpasses the radiologists in distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes (especially the non COVID-19 abnormal class). Our results show that radiologists diagnostic performance improves when incorporating ai-coronas prediction. In addition, we also show that RT-PCRs diagnosis has a much lower sensitivity compared to all the other methods. Conclusion: ai-corona is a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for fast and accurate COVID19 diagnosis in chest CT scans. Our results ascertain that our framework, as a reliable detection tool, also improves experts diagnosis performance and helps especially in diagnosing non-typical COVID-19 cases or non COVID-19 abnormal cases that manifest COVID-19 imaging features in chest CT scan.

	abstract     = {Abstract Introduction : The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs where it may cause pneumonia in severely ill patients. Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.

		Abstract

		Background and aim COVID-19 outbreak has created havoc and a quick cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has usage history in patients to resolve the current pandemic. With technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) coupled with increased computational power, the AI-empowered drug repurposing can prove beneficial in the COVID-19 scenario.

		Methods The recent literature is studied and analyzed from various sources such as Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search terms used are ‘COVID-19′, ' AI ′, and ‘Drug Repurposing'.

		Results AI is implemented in the field design through the generation of the learning-prediction model and performs a quick virtual screening to accurately display the output. With a drug-repositioning strategy, AI can quickly detect drugs that can fight against emerging diseases such as COVID-19. This technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery, planning, treatment, and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool.

		Conclusions Thus, there are chances that the application of the AI approach in drug discovery is feasible. With prior usage experiences in patients, few of the old drugs, if shown active against SARS-CoV-2, can be readily applied to treat the COVID-19 patients. With the collaboration of AI with pharmacology, the efficiency of drug repurposing can improve significantly.

		Abstract

		The clinical management of COVID-19 is challenging. Medical imaging plays a critical role in the early detection, clinical monitoring and outcomes assessment of this disease. Chest x-ray radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are the standard imaging modalities used for the structural assessment of the disease status, while functional imaging (namely, positron emission tomography) has had limited application. Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the predictive power and utilization of these imaging approaches and new approaches focusing on detection, stratification and prognostication are showing encouraging results. We review the current landscape of these imaging modalities and AI approaches as applied in COVID-19 management.

In order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the government emerged several policies. Numerous public health measures can be implemented to counter the risk of an emerging outbreak with pandemic potential. Meanwhile, Jakarta and West Java are the regions with the most confirmed cases in Indonesia, the government announced Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) policy in both provinces. Many researchers conducted forecasting methods for modeling or predict the further number of cases of this pandemic. Forecasting is slightly hard because of those interventions. In this study, we involved some of neural network forecasting methods, including Multi-Layer Perceptron, Neural Network Auto-Regressive, and Extreme Learning Machine meanwhile neural networks become well-known at this time for forecasting the number of active, confirmed, recovered, death, and daily new cases in Jakarta and West Java. These methods are undertaking automatically without considering any factors that will be impacted the result as the reason that we assumed those factors have pursued the pattern of each case. The best model for all of the cases is the MLP (10,10) model. This intervention carried out by the government, namely PSBB, proved effective in reducing the spread of this pandemic in Jakarta and West Java. This can be seen from the results of the daily new cases which show a downward trend for both although still fluctuating.}

	abstract     = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 has emerged as a significant global concern, triggering harsh public health restrictions in a successful bid to curb its exponential growth. As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods are tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.}

		Abstract

		On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since then, many countries have experienced the rapid transmission of this respiratory disease among their populations and have exercised many strategies to mitigate the spread of this disease. The prediction of the transmission dynamics serves important roles in designing mitigation strategies. However, due to the unknown characteristics of this disease, as well as the geographical and political factors, building efficient models of the dynamics for many countries is difficult. The objective of this study is to develop a transmission dynamics predictor that takes advantage of the time differences among many countries with respect to transmission of this disease, in that some countries experienced earlier outbreaks than others. The primary novelty of the proposed method is that, unlike many existing transmission predictors that require parameters based on prior knowledge of the epidemiology of past viruses, the proposed method only requires the transmission similarities between countries in the publicly available data for this current disease. In this paper, the viability and limitations of the proposed method are reported and discussed.

Methods : In this retrospective multi-site study, a fully automated AI framework was developed to extract radiomics features from volumetric chest CT exams to learn the detection pattern of COVID-19 patients. We analysed the data from 181 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients as well as 1200 other non-COVID-19 control patients to build and assess the performance of the model. The datasets were collected from 2 different hospital sites of the CHU Liege, Belgium. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results : 1381 patients were included in this study. The average age was 64.4 and 63.8 years with a gender balance of 56% and 52% male in the COVID-19 and control group, respectively. The final curated dataset used for model construction and validation consisted of chest CT scans of 892 patients. The model sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the test set (training 80% and test 20% of patients) were 78.94% and 91.09%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.9398 (95% CI: 0.875-1). The negative predictive value of the algorithm was found to be larger than 97%. Conclusions : Benchmarked against RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19, our AI framework can accurately differentiate COVID-19 from routine clinical conditions in a fully automated fashion. Thus, providing rapid accurate diagnosis in patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, facilitating the timely implementation of isolation procedures and early intervention.}

	abstract     = {Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) spread far and wide in numerous nations in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. This pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the global population and by now it has infected more than a few million individuals around the world. One significant obstacle in controlling the spreading of this virus is that the initial system for addressing this infectious disease was not clear. A basic advancement in the struggle opposite the COVID-19 pandemic is early screening and dependable diagnosis utilizing computerized detection of lung infections. Computed Tomography (CT) scans and X-rays imagery offers great potential help to clinical specialists tackling COVID-19. An efficient Deep Learning diagnosis application needs to be developed so that accurate and precise prediction can be done for the disease. This paper introduces dataset analysis and comparative evaluation of deep learning models for creating disease diagnosis application using image processing. Comparison is done using three main deep learning models -Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) Logistic Regression. Dataset analysis and model selection is a crucial phase for developing a predictive deep learning algorithm. This analysis is done for better results and is done using Orange data mining software.

The scholarship included here provides critical insights into the institutional responses, communal consequences, cultural adaptations, and social politics that lie at the heart of this pandemic. This volume maps out the ways in which the pandemic has impacted (most often disproportionately) societies, the successes and failures of means used to combat the virus, and the considerations and future possibilities – both positive and negative – that lie ahead. While the pandemic has brought humanity together in some noteworthy ways, it has also laid bare many of the systemic inequalities that lie at the foundation of our global society. This volume is a significant step toward better understanding these impacts. The work presented here represents a remarkable diversity and quality of impassioned scholarship and is a timely and critical advance in knowledge related to the pandemic. This volume and its companion, COVID-19: Volume I: Global Pandemic, Societal Responses, Ideological Solutions, are the result of the collaboration of more than 50 of the leading social scientists from across five continents. The breadth and depth of the scholarship is matched only by the intellectual and global scope of the contributors themselves. The insights presented here have much to offer not just to an understanding of the ongoing world of COVID-19, but also to helping us (re-)build, and better shape, the world beyond.},

To prevent the spread of it, a high sensitivity and efficient method for COVID-19 detection is necessary. By analyzing the COVID-19 chest X-ray images, a combination method of image regrouping and ResNet-SVM was proposed in this study. The lung region was segmented from the original chest X-ray images and divided into small pieces, and then the small pieces of lung region were regrouped into a regular image randomly. Furthermore the regrouped images were fed into the deep residual encoder block for feature extraction. Finally the extracted features were as input into support vector machine for recognition. The visual attention was introduced in the novel method, which paid more attention to the features of COVID-19 without the interference of shapes, rib and other related noises. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 93% accuracy without large number of training data, outperformed the existing COVID-19 detection models.},

	abstract     = {The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature, including those that report findings on radiographs. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. Because a large portion of figures in COVID-19 articles are not CXR or CT, we designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved deep-learning (DL) performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza, another common infectious respiratory illness that may present similarly to COVID-19, and fine-tuned a baseline deep neural network to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We fine-tuned an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared 15 clinical symptoms and 20 clinical findings of COVID-19 versus those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. Our database is unique, as the figures are retrieved along with relevant text with fine-grained descriptions, and it can be extended easily in the future. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

	abstract     = {Recently, with the large-scale outbreak of the global financial crisis and public safety incidents (such as COVID-19), high-performance computing has been widely applied to risk prediction, vaccine development, and other fields. In scenarios where high-performance computing infrastructure responds to the instantaneous explosion of computing demands, a crucial issue is to provide large-scale flexible allocation and adjustment of computing capability by rapidly constructing computing clusters. Existing large-scale computing cluster deployment solutions usually utilize source code deployment or other deployment tools. The great challenge of existing deployment methods is to reduce excessive image distribution time and refrain from configuration defects. In this article, we design an intelligent distributed registry deployment (IDRD) architecture based on the OpenStack cloud platform, which adaptively places distributed image repositories using the containerized deployment of multiple registries. We propose a server load priority algorithm to solve multiple registries placement problems in IDRD. Furthermore, we devise a clustering algorithm based on demand density that can optimize the global performance of IDRD and improve large-scale cluster load balancing capabilities, which has been implemented in the TianHe Supercomputing environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IDRD can effectively reduce 30% - 50% of the distribution time of component images and significantly improve the efficiency of large-scale cluster deployment.},

	abstract     = {Purpose: Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) scans plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, for example, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide more than 40 pretrained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We achieve average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3%, 97.7%, and 67.3% and average normalized surface dice (NSD) scores of 90.6%, 91.4%, and 70.0% for left lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning benchmark for medical image segmentation, and the largest number of pretrained models up to now. All these resources are publicly available, and our work lays the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for efficient COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.},

	abstract     = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the highly contagious viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a catastrophic effect on the world’s demographics resulting in more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide, emerging as the most consequential global health crisis since the era of the influenza pandemic of 1918. After the first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2  rapidly disseminated across the world in a short span of time, compelling the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since being declared a global pandemic, COVID-19 has ravaged many countries worldwide and has overwhelmed many healthcare systems. The pandemic has also resulted in the loss of livelihoods due to prolonged shutdowns, which have had a rippling effect on the global economy. Even though substantial progress in clinical research has led to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the management of COVID-19, limiting the continuing spread of this virus and its variants has become an issue of increasing concern, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to wreak havoc across the world, with many countries enduring a second or third wave of outbreaks of this viral illness attributed mainly due to the emergence of mutant variants of the virus.  Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2, while adapting to their new human hosts, is prone to genetic evolution with the development of mutations over time, resulting in mutant variants that may have different characteristics than its ancestral strains. Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been described during the course of this pandemic, among which only a few are considered variants of concern (VOCs) by the WHO, given their impact on global public health. Based on the recent epidemiological update by the WHO, as of June 22, 2021, four SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic: Alpha (B.1.1.7): first variant of concern described in the United Kingdom (UK) in late December 2020. Beta (B.1.351): first reported in South Africa in December 2020. Gamma(P.1): first reported in Brazil in early January 2021. Delta (B.1.617.2): first reported in India in December 2020. Despite the unprecedented speed of vaccine development against the prevention of COVID-19 and robust global mass vaccination efforts, the emergence of these new SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens to overturn the significant progress made so far in limiting the spread of this viral illness. This review article aims to comprehensively describe the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and the latest novel therapeutics in the management of COVID-19. This review also briefly provides an overview of the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of different available vaccines for prevention against COVID-19 and its variants.},

abstract = {Testing for COVID-19 has been unable to keep up with the demand. Further, the false negative rate is projected to be as high as 30% and test results can take some time to obtain. X-ray machines are widely available and provide images for diagnosis quickly. This paper explores how useful chest X-ray images can be in diagnosing COVID-19 disease. We have obtained 122 chest X-rays of COVID-19 and over 4,000 chest X-rays of viral and bacterial pneumonia. A pretrained deep convolutional neural network has been tuned on 102 COVID-19 cases and 102 other pneumonia cases in a 10-fold cross validation. The results were all 102 COVID-19 cases were correctly classified and there were 8 false positives resulting in an AUC of 0.997. On a test set of 20 unseen COVID-19 cases all were correctly classified and more than 95% of 4171 other pneumonia examples were correctly classified. This study has flaws, most critically a lack of information about where in the disease process the COVID-19 cases were and the small data set size. More COVID-19 case images will enable a better answer to the question of how useful chest X-rays can be for diagnosing COVID-19 (so please send them).},

abstract={The world is facing a pandemic due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), named as per the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is caused by the virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was initially discovered in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Later, the virus had spread throughout the world within a few months. COVID-19 has become a global health crisis because millions of people worldwide are affected by this fatal virus. Fever, dry cough, and gastrointestinal problems are the most common signs of COVID-19. The disease is highly contagious, and affected people can easily spread the virus to those with whom they have close contact. Thus, contact tracing is a suitable solution to prevent the virus from spreading. The method of identifying all persons with whom a COVID-19-affected patient has come into contact in the last 2 weeks is called contact tracing. This study presents an investigation of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which makes the test faster and more reliable, to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Because there are many studies in this field, the designed model focuses on increasing the accuracy level and uses a transfer learning approach and a custom model. Pretrained deep CNN models, such as VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50, have been used for deep feature extraction. The performance measurement in this study was based on classification accuracy. The results of this study indicate that deep learning can recognize SARS-CoV-2 from CXR images. The designed model provided 93{\&}{\#}x0025; accuracy and 98{\&}{\#}x0025; validation accuracy, and the pretrained customized models such as MobileNetV2 obtained 97{\&}{\#}x0025; accuracy, InceptionV3 obtained 98{\&}{\#}x0025;, and VGG16 obtained 98{\&}{\#}x0025; accuracy, respectively. Among these models, InceptionV3 has recorded the highest accuracy.},
